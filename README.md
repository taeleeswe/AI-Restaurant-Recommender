# AI Restaurant Recommender

AI Restaurant Recommender is a cutting-edge web application powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT API. It offers personalized restaurant recommendations based on your food preferences, all within the vibrant culinary landscape of New York City. 

This project draws inspiration from the 'Build A ChatGPT AI in JavaScript' course by Clarian North on Udemy. While the core concept is derived from the course, I've customized and extended the application to create a personalized experience.

## Features

- **Food Recommendations:** Simply describe the type of food you crave, and the app generates three restaurant suggestions tailored to your taste.
